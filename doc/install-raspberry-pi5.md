# HowTo setup Raspberry Pi 5 and Hailo-8

In this guide, you will learn how to setup the Raspberry Pi 5 with a Hailo-8 AI accelerator.

What you'll need

- A Raspberry Pi 5
- A Raspberry M.2 M-Key HAT
- A Hailo-8 / Hailo8L M.2 module

From the Hailo Developer Zone

- HailoRT â€“ PCIe driver Ubuntu package (deb) version 4.17.0
  - hailort-pcie-driver_4.17.0_all.deb
- HailoRT Ubuntu package (deb) version 4.17.0
  - hailort_4.17.0_arm64.deb

## Hardware

For this guide the Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB RAM) model with the official Active Cooler and 27W USB-C Power Supply was used. The 4 GB model will likely work as well. The official USB-C power supply is recommended to ensure the board can supply the power for the M.2 hat.

### Raspberry Pi M.2 M-Key Hat

The Raspberry Pi M.2 M-Key Hat can be used with the Hailo-8 M.2 key M or B+M. In ether case only a single PCIe gen 2 lane is available on the Raspberry Pi 5.

### Update system

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Installing Requirements

#### Driver requirements
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-kernel-headers \
build-essential dkms
```
#### TAAPAS requirements
The following APT packages need to be installed, using the command below:

* ffmpeg
* x11-utils
* python3 (pip and setuptools).
* python3-virtualenv
* python-gi-dev
* libgirepository1.0-dev
* gcc-12 and g++-12
* cmake
* libzmq3-dev
* git
* rsync
* OpenCV 4
* Gstreamer
* PyObject

#### TAPPAS GStreamer and pyobject requirements
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y rsync ffmpeg x11-utils python3-dev \
python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-virtualenv \
python-gi-dev libgirepository1.0-dev \
gcc-12 g++-12 cmake git libzmq3-dev \
libopencv-dev python3-opencv \
libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev \
libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools \
gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl \
gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio \
gstreamer1.0-libcamera \
python-gi-dev python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```
#### You may need to run the following command to fix apt dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get  --fix-broken install
```

### Set PCIe to Gen3
##### Setting Gen3 PCIe is required to get higher performance from the Hailo device.
Add the following line to /boot/firmware/config.txt 
```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
# add the following line to the end of the file
dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
```
For more information see:
 https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/forcing-pci-express-gen-30-speeds-on-pi-5

### Install PCIe driver

```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailort-pcie-driver_4.17.0_all.deb
```

### Installing HailoRT

```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailort_4.17.0_arm64.deb
```
When asked "Do you wish to activate hailort service? (required for most pyHailoRT use cases) [y/N]" press "y".

### Verify installation
Now you can check if the Hailo-8 is recognized by the system.

```bash
hailortcli fw-control identify
```

If everything is ok it should output something like this:

```bash
Executing on device: 0000:01:00.0
Identifying board
Control Protocol Version: 2
Firmware Version: 4.16.0 (release,app,extended context switch buffer)
Logger Version: 0
Board Name: Hailo-8
Device Architecture: HAILO8
Serial Number: HLLWM2A224101556
Part Number: HM218B1C2FAE
Product Name: HAILO-8 AI ACC M.2 M KEY MODULE EXT TEMP
```

##### PCIe Trouble shooting
Make sure the PCIe board and trhe m.2 module are properly connected.
To test if the PCIe board is recognized by the system, run the following command:

```bash
lspci | grep Hailo
```
If you get output like:
```bash
0000:01:00.0 Co-processor: Hailo Technologies Ltd. Hailo-8 AI Processor (rev 01)
```
Then the PCIe board is recognized by the system.
If not check the connection, power supply and make sure the PCIe is enabled see Raspberry Pi documentation.
If the board is new you may need to update the firmware of the Raspberry Pi 5. 

##### Driver issue
If you get an error saying Hailo driver is not installed, reinstall the driver and reboot the system.
```bash
[HailoRT] [error] Can't find hailo pcie class, this may happen if the driver is not installed (this may happen if the kernel was updated), or if there is no connected Hailo board
```
To reinstall the driver run the following command again:
```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailort-pcie-driver_4.17.0_all.deb
```

### Install TAPPAS core

```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailo-tappas-core_3.28.1_arm64.deb
```

#### Installation should be completed by rebooting the system.
```bash
sudo reboot
```
#### Test installation by running the following commands:

##### If everything is ok you can continue installing the [hailo_rpi5_examples.](../README.md#configure-environment)

## Trouble shooting
If you get an error saying the plugin is not found, you may need to clear the GStreamer cache.

```bash
rm ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.aarch64.bin
```
#### The issues below should be handled by the installation script, but if you encounter them you can fix them manually.

##### PCIe Page size issue
Add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf
You shuold create the file if it does not exist.

```txt
options hailo_pci force_desc_page_size=4096
```

You can do this with the following command.
Somtimes there are permission issue, so you may need to use editor with sudo rights. See below.

```bash
sudo echo 'options hailo_pci force_desc_page_size=4096' >> \
/etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf
```

If this does not work oopen the file with nano and add the line manually.
(To save the file in nano press Ctrl+X, then Y and Enter.)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf
```


###### LD_LIBRARY_PATH issue 
Shuold be fixed by adding this to your .bashrc file
```bash
echo 'export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1' \
 >> ~/.bashrc
```

This should fix the error causing some Gstreamer plugins to not load corretly.
The error message is:
```bash
(gst-plugin-scanner:67): GStreamer-WARNING **: 12:20:39.178: Failed to load plugin '/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstlibav.so': /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
```
If you already encountered this error, you can fix it by running the following commands:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1
rm ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.aarch64.bin
```
