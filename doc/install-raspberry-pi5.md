## What You'll Need
- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry M.2 M-Key HAT
- Hailo8L M.2 module (Hailo-8 is also supported)
- From the Hailo Developer Zone:
  - HailoRT â€“ PCIe driver Ubuntu package (deb) version 4.17.0
    - hailort-pcie-driver_4.17.0_all.deb
  - HailoRT Ubuntu package (deb) version 4.17.0
    - hailort_4.17.0_arm64.deb

## Hardware
For this guide, the Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB RAM) model with the official Active Cooler and 27W USB-C Power Supply was used. The official USB-C power supply is recommended to ensure the board can supply power to the M.2 hat.

### Update System
```
When asked "Do you wish to activate hailort service? (required for most pyHailoRT use cases) [y/N]" press "N".
Service can be activated later if needed.

### Verify Installation
Now you can check if the Hailo chip is recognized by the system.
```bash
hailortcli fw-control identify
```
If everything is OK, it should output something like this:
```bash
Executing on device: 0000:01:00.0
Identifying board
Control Protocol Version: 2
Firmware Version: 4.16.0 (release,app,extended context switch buffer)
Logger Version: 0
Board Name: Hailo-8
Device Architecture: HAILO8
Serial Number: HLLWM2A224101556
Part Number: HM218B1C2FAE
Product Name: HAILO-8 AI ACC M.2 M KEY MODULE EXT TEMP
```
If you don't see this output, check the [PCIe troubleshooting](#pcie-troubleshooting) section.
### Install TAPPAS core

```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailo-tappas-core_3.28.1_arm64.deb
```

#### Installation should be completed by rebooting the system.
```bash
sudo reboot
```
#### Test installation by running the following commands:

Hailotools:
```bash
gst-inspect-1.0 hailotools

If hailo or hailotools are not found, try deleting the GStreamer registry.
```bash
rm ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.aarch64.bin
```
##### If everything is ok you can continue installing the [hailo_rpi5_examples.](../README.md#configure-environment)

## Troubleshooting

### PCIe Troubleshooting
Make sure the PCIe board and the M.2 module are properly connected. To test if the PCIe board is recognized by the system, run the following command:
```bash
lspci | grep Hailo
```
If you get output like:
```bash
0000:01:00.0 Co-processor: Hailo Technologies Ltd. Hailo-8 AI Processor (rev 01)
```
Then the PCIe board is recognized by the system. If not, check the connection, power supply, and make sure the PCIe is enabled (see Raspberry Pi documentation). If the board is new, you may need to update the firmware of the Raspberry Pi 5.

### Driver Issue
If you get an error saying the Hailo driver is not installed, reinstall the driver and reboot the system.
```bash
[HailoRT] [error] Can't find hailo pcie class, this may happen if the driver is not installed (this may happen if the kernel was updated), or if there is no connected Hailo board
```
To reinstall the driver, run the following command again:
```bash
sudo dpkg --install hailort-pcie-driver_4.17.0_all.deb
```

## known issues
The issues below should be handled by the installation script, but if you encounter them you can fix them manually.

### PCIe Page Size Issue
Add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf. You should create the file if it does not exist.
```txt
options hailo_pci force_desc_page_size=4096
```
You can do this with the following command. Sometimes there are permission issues, so you may need to use an editor with sudo rights. See below.
```bash
sudo echo 'options hailo_pci force_desc_page_size=4096' >> /etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf
```
If this does not work, open the file with nano and add the line manually.
(To save the file in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y and Enter.)
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/hailo_pci.conf
```

### LD_LIBRARY_PATH Issue
Should be fixed by adding this to your .bashrc file:
```bash
echo 'export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1' >> ~/.bashrc
```
This should fix the error causing some Gstreamer plugins to not load correctly. The error message is:
```bash
(gst-plugin-scanner:67): GStreamer-WARNING **: 12:20:39.178: Failed to load plugin '/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstlibav.so': /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block
```
If you already encountered this error, you can fix it by running the following commands:
```bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1
rm ~/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.aarch64.bin
```
