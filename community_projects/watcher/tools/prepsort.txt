I want to create a general purpose tool to sort ai training data prior to training. the tool s is to be written in python and will run under windows. The input to the prepsort tool is an output directory that contains subdirectories titled in YYYY-MM-DD format. within each of these date labelled directories are a number of JSON files containing a flat hierarch of labels and values. The filenames are based on a timestamp of the form YYYMMDD_HHMMSS_NNN_XXXXXXXX. The X portion of these mes could be anything. Alongside JSON in the directory are MP4 files and possibly JPG files with matching timestamp names. 

The purpose of the tool is to go through all of the JSON files and match them based on filter criteria I will give you in a minute. For all files that match take the equivalent MP4 video file and copy it to an output directory. These matched files will be used for ai model training.

the filter criteria are taken from a JSON file "prepsort-config.json". This is a JSON file containing the labels and values that should be considered for a match.

The prepsort program should take command line args for the root of the original output directory being scanned and for the target folder where the MP4 files should be copies.
